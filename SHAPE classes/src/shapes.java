Write shape classes with methods perimeter and area.
We'd like to be able to write client code that treats different kinds of shape objects in the same way, such as:
–Write a method that prints any shape's area and perimeter.

–Create an array of shapes that could hold a mixture of the various shape objects.

–Write a method that could return a rectangle, a circle, a triangle, or any other shape we've written.

EC: Make a Drawing Method to display many shapes on screen.



Rectangle (as defined by width w and height h):
  area  = w h

  perimeter  = 2w + 2h

–

Circle (as defined by radius r):
  area  = p r2

  perimeter  = 2 p r

–

Triangle (as defined by side lengths a, b, and c)
  area  = √(s (s - a) (s - b) (s - c))

     where s = ½ (a + b + c)

  perimeter  = a + b + c
